# TongoGameOfLife
Code for the Tongo Game of Life Commissions Game built for Paper Crane Factory and Tongo

This is the working draft as of September 15th, 2024. All mechanics and UI are present. Now, all maps are in, and I have tried to do a little bit of balancing. The game should take a maximum of 1-2 minutes in total to complete. I have also added SFX via some sounds I found off of Pixabay. I think they make it a little more fun, but feel free to mute the computer this is playing on if need be.

I have also fixed any of the bugs or changes uncovered through PaperCraneFactory's playtesting.

EDIT:STILL A PROBLEM WITH PLAYER LOADING AFTER GAME OVER TODO #1 PRIORITY

To integrate with the actual website, you should pretty much be able to directly embed main.js into a frame within your own HTML.
